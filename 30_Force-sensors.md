# Force sensors

This is only for licking force and potentially body force measurement.
You can find the fabricating and assembling process from the video at the beginning of this email.
The process is by no means simple, but I imagine most projects probably won't need them.

## Sensor core

This is the modularized unit for the mechano-optical transduction.

## Signal conditioning board

This converts up to four channels of phototransistor current to voltage change.
